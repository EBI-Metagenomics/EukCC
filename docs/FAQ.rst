GeneMark-ES problems
========================

**EukCC fails with message: GeneMark-ES failed on this bin:** 
This means that GeneMark-ES failed to complete for this particular bin.
This can be caused by very short or very fragmented MAGs. Most of the time
this will mean that your MAG is not even 50 percent complete and you can most 
likely dicard it.

You can always try to predict proteins unsing another method and then supply 
them directly to EukCC.
